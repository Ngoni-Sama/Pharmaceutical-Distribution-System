I would first like to appreciate the the noble course of Refugees United and inclined to be a part of a life changing team. My love of all that would improve the lives of everyone around me is incredible. I am thrilled to apply the knowledge, creativity, innovation and expertise that I have gained through projects that I have worked on and interact with the world at such a passionate level.
I am aggressive, quick to learn and keen on quality while still not compromising on output produced, great with individual as well as team projects.
I am in my final year of study - I have completed all coursework and the requirement left for me to graduate is an industrial attachment/internship. My intention of applying here is not to simply fulfill my course requirement but to truly participate in this life changing project. I do not intent to treat this job application as an internship instead I hope to be shortlisted to prove my worth and potential. I have a few projects I have on GitHub www.github.com/stevenkayter.
